title: SRE Manager, Kubernetes Administrator
testimonial: "I worked with Jon on the SRE team at Built and I was thoroughly impressed by with his abilities and his SRE mindset. As the SRE team, we had to respond quickly to improve our company's monitoring needs to mitigate future problems. He showed high proficiency with using Datadog, Cloudwatch and Terraform through our day to day. The team was comprised of people from multiple skill levels, Staff, Senior and mid-level and Jon produced the same quality work as everyone else.
