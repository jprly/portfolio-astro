first: Jacob
last: Weyer
title: Engineering Manager, DevOps at Built Technologies
testimonial: "I had the pleasure of working with and managing Jon for around ~7 months of his tenure at Built. Jon showed great promise and a knack for critical thinking that really helped us start the formation of our Site Reliability team at Built and his efforts focused around PagerDuty adoption, DataDog monitoring, terraform module creation and more showed that he's a strong and capable engineer. I would absolutely hire Jonathan again and bring him back into the fold. As he continues to learn he will be an ever increasing asset in any position he holds moving forward."
